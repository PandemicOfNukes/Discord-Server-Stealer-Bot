# Discord-Server-Stealer-Bot

This simple Discord Bot is what I call a Discord Server Stealer. Basically it takes advantage of Discord Servers that the Roles and Permissions settings that are badly configured.

It works by elevating the message author (the attacker) to the specified role.

This bot was made as an exposition to a friend of mine why its important to well configure Permission Systems (Such as Active Directory) and Login Systems to avoid attacks and exploits.

This bot was never used to attack real Discord Servers, only Test Servers.

REQUIREMENTS:

1.A Discord API KEY

2.Discord.py API
